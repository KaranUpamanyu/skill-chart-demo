This is a demo of the skill chart I built while working at Lyearn.

The chart at Lyearn has additional features, such as:

- Data sourcing from real users on the platform
- onClick actions, interactivity, and state management as part of the profile page
- Displaying average scores with a good/fair/bad meter in the center of the chart
